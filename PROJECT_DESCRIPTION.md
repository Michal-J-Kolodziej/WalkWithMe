# WalkWithMe Project Description

**WalkWithMe** is a web application that enables people to find others for joint dog walks. To use it, users must register an account and be logged in. During registration, the user also creates a profile, which should include:

- A profile picture showing their face
- Name
- Age
- Description/Bio
- Location (city)
- Friends list
- List of scheduled meetings

Additionally, every user **MUST** have at least one profile for their dog. A dog's profile should include:

- **AT LEAST** one photo of the dog with the user
- Dog's name
- Age
- Breed
- Description/Bio

After logging in, users can browse cards with other users' profiles on the home page. Through these cards, they can send friend requests along with a message.

Users can view their invitations and messages, with the ability to accept or reject invitations. Rejecting an invitation can optionally include a message explaining the reason for the refusal.

Each user has a separate text chat with every friend. Users can create meetings as events and invite their friends to them. A meeting should include:

- A list of participants and dogs
- Date and time of the event
- Map location where the meeting will take place
- Meeting description

The event author can remove users from or invite new users to the event. When accepting a meeting invitation, the invited user selects which of their dogs will participate and which will stay at home.
