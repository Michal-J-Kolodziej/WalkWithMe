# Dashboard Functional Testing

A systematic process for testing all dashboard routes and interactive elements in the browser, documenting bugs and unexpected behaviors for later fixing.

## When to Use This Skill

- After implementing new features or major changes
- Before a release or milestone
- When the user reports "something is broken" without specifics
- For regression testing after refactoring

## Prerequisites

1. **App Running**: Development server running (`npm run dev`)
2. **Authenticated**: Have login credentials ready or ability to register
3. **Browser Tool**: You will use `browser_subagent` to test the app

---

## Phase 1: Setup

**Goal:** Prepare environment and create bug report file.

1. **Check server**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. If error, run:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/michal/Documents/MyApps/WalkWithMe && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login or Register**:
   - Use existing account OR register new (e.g., `tester@walkwithme.test`)
   - ⚠️ If login/register fails → log as Bug #1, STOP

3. **Complete profile** if required to access dashboard

4. **Create bug report** at project root: `DASHBOARD_BUGS.md`

   ```markdown
   # Dashboard Bug Report

   > Generated: [current date]
   > Tester: AI Agent

   ---
   ```

---

## Phase 2: Route Testing

**Goal:** Test each route systematically, logging bugs immediately.

### Test Workflow (per route)

1. Navigate to route
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Run tests from table below
4. Log bugs immediately when found
5. Continue to next route

### Stop Conditions

- ✅ All 10 routes tested → write summary, finish
- 🛑 Critical blocker → write summary, finish
- ⚠️ 10+ bugs found → write summary, pause for fixes

## Phase 3: Bug Reporting

Append each bug to `DASHBOARD_BUGS.md`:

```markdown
## Bug #[N]: [Short title]

**Route**: `/dashboard/[page]`  
**Severity**: Critical | High | Medium | Low  
**Issue**: [1-2 sentences]  
**Expected**: [What should happen]  
**Console**: [Error or "None"]  
**Fix hint**: [Suggestion for fixing]
```

### Severity Scale

| Level        | Description                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Crash, data loss, can't proceed |
| **High**     | Feature broken, can work around |
| **Medium**   | Works but poor UX               |
| **Low**      | Cosmetic, typo                  |

---

## Phase 4: Summary Report

**Goal:** Summarize findings at the top of the report.

After testing, **prepend** to `DASHBOARD_BUGS.md`:

```markdown
## Test Summary

| Metric        | Value                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Routes Tested | X/10                          |
| Critical      | X                             |
| High          | X                             |
| Medium        | X                             |
| Low           | X                             |
| Skipped       | X                             |
| Status        | Stable / Needs Fixes / Broken |

### Priority Fixes

1. Bug #X - [reason]
2. Bug #X - [reason]
3. Bug #X - [reason]

---
```

---

## Scope Variants

### `full` (default)

Test all 10 routes with all tests.

### `quick`

Test only routes 1-4 (Dashboard, Dogs, Profile, Settings) - core functionality.

### `[route-name]`

Test a specific route only (e.g., `meetings`, `chat`).

---

## Out of Scope

Do NOT test:

- Real-time sync between two users
- Email notifications sending
- External API failures (weather down)
- Pixel-perfect visuals (use `visual-audit` skill)
- Mobile responsiveness (desktop only)
