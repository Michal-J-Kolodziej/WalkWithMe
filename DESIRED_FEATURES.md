# Wishlist for WalkWithMe 🐾

As a dog owner using this app, I'm really enjoying the core features! To strictly make this my "go-to" app for everything dog-related, I'd love to see these additions:

## 1. 🦮 Walk Tracker & History
**Why:** I want to track how much my dog exercises and where we've been.
**Features:**
- **Active Tracking:** "Start Walk" button that tracks GPS route, duration, and distance.
- **History Log:** A calendar or list view showing past walks (e.g., "Last week you walked 15km!").
- **Heatmap:** Visual representation of our most frequented routes.

## 2. 📍 Dog-Friendly Spots Map
**Why:** Finding new places to go is hard, and I need to know if they are safe/verifyed.
**Features:**
- **Map Layers:** Toggle view for Dog Parks, Vet Clinics, Pet Stores, and Dog-friendly Cafes.
- **User Reviews:** Specifically for dog owners (e.g., "Is this park fully fenced?", "Is there water available?", "High traffic area?").
- **Add Spot:** Allow users to submit new locations.

## 3. ⚠️ Safety & Community Alerts
**Why:** Keeping my community safe is the #1 priority.
**Features:**
- **Lost Dog Alert:** Push notification to nearby users (within 5km) if a dog is reported missing.
- **Hazard Reporting:** Mark broken glass, poison warnings, or aggressive wildlife on the map.
- **SOS Button:** Quick access to emergency contacts or local vet.

## 4. 🤝 Advanced "Playdate" Matching
**Why:** Not all dogs get along. I need to find the *right* match for my reactive or high-energy dog.
**Features:**
- **Advanced Filters:** Filter Discovery by Size, Energy Level, Breed, and "Friendliness" tags (e.g., "Shy", "Reactive", "Playful").
- **Compatibility Scores:** A simple match % based on profile data (e.g., "90% Match with Luna").

## 5. 🌡️ Smart Weather & Paws
**Why:** I need to know if it's safe to walk *right now*.
**Features:**
- **Pavement Heat Check:** Warning if the temperature suggests the pavement might be too hot for paws (> 25°C).
- **Rain/Storm Alerts:** "Rain imminent" alert 15 mins before a scheduled meetup.

## 6. 📢 "Walking Now" Beacon
**Why:** Spontaneous meetups are often the best ones.
**Features:**
- **Live Status:** Toggle "I'm Walking Now" to notify close friends.
- **Ghost Mode:** Ability to be visible only to "Best Friends" or go completely invisible.

## 7. 📸 Doggy Scrapbook / Media Gallery
**Why:** I take 100 photos a walk anyway, I want them organized by dog.
**Features:**
- **Photo Attachments:** Ability to attach photos to specific "Walks" or "Meetings".
- **Dog Profile Gallery:** A dedicated scrollable gallery of photos for each dog, separate from the profile pic.

## 8. 🩹 Health & Care Log
**Why:** I often forget when the last flea treatment was.
**Features:**
- **Basic Reminders:** Recurring alerts for Vaccinations, Flea/Tick meds, and Grooming.
- **Weight Tracker:** Simple graph to track weight over time.
